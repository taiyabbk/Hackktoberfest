### Learn how to create issues, Fork a repo, makes changes, and ask the maintainers to review and merge it

## Creating Pull Request

You have a GitHub repo and can push to it. All is well. But how the heck do you contribute to other people's GitHub projects? That is what I wanted to know after I learned git and GitHub. I will explain how to fork a git repo, make changes, and submit a pull request.

### Step 1: Fork the repository

- When you want to work on another's GitHub project, the first step is to fork a repo.<br>
  <img src="img/fork.png" width="1000" /><br>

- Once there click on the Fork button in the top-right corner. This creates a new copy of the repo under your Github user account.

### Step 2: Clone the repository:

- Clone this Github repo. Open up the GitBash/Command Line and type in:<br>
  <img src="img/git clone.png" width="1000"/><br>
  
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/ananddasani/Java-Practice-Course.git
```
Don't forget to write your GitHub user name in place of _YOUR_USERNAME_

### Step 3: Create a development branch

- `cd` into the parent directory. Now create a branch of the master by pushing the command <br>
  <img src="img/git Branch.png" width="1000" /><br>

```git
$ git checkout -b <YOUR-USERNAME>
```

- You can now check the branches by pushing in the command: git branch. You will see the Master Branch and another branch with your username.


- Start Coding üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª. Make apt commits with proper commit messages. Always use git status to see that you have not made changes on the file you were supposed not to.

- Add all the changes with this command: (`git add .`). This will add the changes to your present workspace. <br>
  <img src="img/git add.png" width="1000"/><br>

  ```git
  $ git add <FILE_NAME>
  ```
To stage all the changed files, type in:

  ```git
  $ git add --all  or  $ git add .
  ```
This command snapshots the file in preparation for versioning and further adds it to the staging area.

- Make a commit. This will save a snapshot of your Project.<br>
  <img src="img/git commit.png" width="1000"/><br>

  ```git
  $ git commit -m "Your Message"
  ```
  
### Step 4: Push your changes

- Upload all local branch commits to the remote repository.
- Push the changes: git push <br>
  <img src="img/git push.png" width="1000"/><br>

  ```git
  $ git push origin <branch_name>
  ```

### Step 5: Creating a Pull Request

- Once you push the changes to your repo, Go to your forked repository, the Compare & pull request button will appear in GitHub.<br>
  <img src="img/compare&pull.png" width="1000"/><br>

- Click it and you'll be taken to this screen.<br>
  <img src="img/create pull request.png" width="1000"/><br>
  - Open a pull request by clicking the Create pull request button. This allows the repo's maintainers to reviews your work. From here, they can merge it if it is good, or they may ask you for some changes.<br>

## Creating an issue

Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests.

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Under your repository name, click on the Issues button.
  <img src="img/issue.png" /><br>

- Click New issue.
  <img src="img/new issue.png" /><br>
  - After creating the issue you have to wait until the project maintainer assigns the issue to you.
  - when you're finished, click Submit new issue.

## Here are some 12 Rules

#### You should be following while doing Open-Source to make your Contributions shine during the whole process:

- Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR)
- Check if the Issue you created, exists or not.
- Make proper commit messages and document your PR well.
- Always add Comments in your Code and explain it at points.
- Dynamic Input is always preferred over static Driver Code.
- Squash your commits before you push them.
- Always create a Pull Request from a Branch; Never from the Master.
- Follow proper Code conventions. Using i, j in Loops show a poor understanding of Code Quality. Use proper Variable, Function Names.
- Issues would be served on "First Come, First Serve" basis.
- Issues would be tagged as Easy, Medium, Hard. Scores would be assigned on the difficulty of Issue you solve.
- Code would be reviewed by Mentors before they are merged. Every PR requires 3 Reviews.
- No person can take up more than 2 Issues at a single point of time.
